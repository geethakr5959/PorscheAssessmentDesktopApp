# PorscheAssessmentDesktopApp
This repo is added for the interview assessment happened for Porsche. The scope is, there will be sensors that sends data to the ui and UI should display the data. UI also can edit the sensor value and set it back to the sensors. For this I have used TCP/IP and created two applications. One is Android and another(this one) Compose Desktop app.
